- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marcallo
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to do web development and want to work remotely.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby on Rails with Mashrur Hossain's course and am finding that he is very patient and clear. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whoever can help with the mental struggles of trying something somewhat news
- 📫 How to reach me.  My email address is marc2bon@gmail.com and I would love to have a cheery message from anybody who is also feeling a bit intimidated.  
     I have now also signed up for Java, due to the special pricing.  Let's hope I can complete the Rails homework and am not trying to toddle before I can crawl.
